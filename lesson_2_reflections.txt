What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
In this we just create a sort of new workplace in which we can start a new project. We need it because we need multiple repositories for multiple project

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area contains the files that are to be commited to the repository but not yet commited. It helps us commit one logical change at a time rather than commit one file at a time
