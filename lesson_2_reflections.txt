What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
In this we just create a sort of new workplace in which we can start a new project. We need it 
because we need multiple repositories for multiple project

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area contains the files that are to be commited to the repository but not yet commited. It helps us commit 
one logical change at a time rather than commit one file at a time

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Sometimes a logical change can extend over more than one files and so to commit per 
logical change we have to more than one files together. Staging Area helps us do this.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches help us experiment with different features which can be later merged with the 
master branch. So it helps us manage our history by helping us branch out our project in 
diferent directions and if it doesn't work out we can just go back and delete that branch.
