Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This is because we may not want to share our work with other collaborators only after we 
may have finished working on a particular feature. And completing one feature often takes more
than one commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?
Fork is specific to Github, it allows cloning on Github without having it to clone
it to our local repository first. It is useful when we can directly edit files on github.
Fork is mainly used when we dont have permission to change the file. Branches are used when 
we want to change a particular piece of code or add a new feature and we have permision to 
modify the original.
